Started to learn about WebSockets to implement some features in personal projects. In this projects I'll create a chat app.

1)Implemented basic chat functionalities using websockets
2)Added styling
3)Allowed users to insert username 
4)Implemented left and joined functionalities. When user leaves or enters a room it will be displayed.
5)Added a basic "user is typing" functionality. I still have to improve it though.
