Started to learn about WebSockets to implement some features in personal projects. In this projects I'll create a chat app.

1)Implemented basic chat functionalities using websockets
2)Added styling
3)Allowed users to insert username 
4)Implemented left and joined functionalities. When user leaves or enters a room it will be displayed.
5)Added a basic "user is typing" functionality. I still have to improve it though.

1)Added a div for online users. On it, the name of the users online are displayed. They are stored now inside an array in the server. Everytime a user logs in, his/her name is inserted inside this array and when they leave, their name are removed.
2)Displayed number of users online. The only thing is that it will add one more even if the user didn't choose a username. That means if users are in the username page they will count as online...
3)

THINGS I NEED TO IMPLEMENT

1)when a new user enters the room he/she cannot see the names of the online users who entered the room before. I have to fix that. (DONE)
